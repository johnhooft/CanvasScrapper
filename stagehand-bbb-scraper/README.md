## Analysis of Playwright vs Stagehand
Stagehand vs. Playwright

Playwright:
- Fast and efficient, suitable for high-throughput scraping.
- Produces consistent, deterministic results when DOM structure is stable.
- Fragile in the face of website changesâ€”scrapers relying on exact selectors or DOM paths are likely to break if the structure shifts.

Stagehand
- More resilient to layout or structural changes, as it relies on semantic interpretation rather than strict selectors.
- Slower and more resource-intensive due to LLM-based processing.
- Output may vary depending on the LLM's interpretation, especially in ambiguous or loosely structured content.
